# Flutter Login UI

Welcome to my Flutter repository showcasing an simple beautiful designed login UI! It offers an immersive and intuitive experience for users to authenticate and access their accounts effortlessly.

# About Me

My name is Muhammad Arslan, and I have been working with Flutter for the past 2 years. During this time, I have developed numerous Flutter applications, honing my skills and expertise in Flutter app development.

# Key Features

- **Sign In**: The login UI presents a visually appealing "Sign In" title at the center, emphasizing the purpose of the screen.

- **Email Input Field**: A customized email input field is provided, allowing users to enter their email address securely. The input field is designed with rounded corners, a subtle shadow effect, and a hint text of "Enter your Email" in white color.

- **Password Input Field**: An interactive password input field enables users to securely input their passwords. Similar to the email field, it features rounded corners, a shadow effect, and a hint text of "Enter your Password" in white color. It also includes a lock icon as a prefix and an eye icon to toggle password visibility.

- **Forgot Password**: A "Forgot Password?" link is conveniently placed at the right corner, allowing users to reset their passwords if needed. The link is styled with white color, an underline decoration, and a subtle hover effect.

- **Remember Me Checkbox**: A checkbox labeled "Remember me" is provided to allow users to choose whether they want their login credentials to be remembered. The checkbox is styled with a white checkmark and text in white color.

- **Login Button**: A visually striking "LOGIN" button is displayed at the bottom, designed with a white background and rounded corners. When clicked, it triggers the login process.

- **Social Media Integration**: Users have the option to sign in using their Facebook or Google accounts. Facebook and Google logos are displayed, allowing users to easily select their preferred authentication method.

- **Sign Up Prompt**: A message is included at the bottom to encourage users who do not have an account to sign up. The text is styled in white color, with the phrase "Don't Have an Account?" and a bold "Sign Up" link.
